# Student-Record-Management

## Problem Statement

Building a mini Student Record Management program.

In a university, there is a need to manage student records efficiently. Create a program in C++ that allows users to add, update, and display student information. The program should utilize file handling, object-oriented programming, and functions.

Minimum requirements:

    Define a class Student with the following attributes (5 points):
        Student ID (integer)
        Name (string)
        Age (integer)
        Grade (float)
    Implement member functions for the Student  class (5 points):
        A constructor to initialize the attributes.
        A function to display student details.
        A function to update student details.
    The program should read and write student records to a file. Implement functions to (7 points):
        Write a new student record to the file.
        Read all student records from the file.
        Update an existing student record in the file.
    Create a menu-driven interface with the following options (3 points):
        Add a new student record.
        Update an existing student record.
        Display all student records.
        Exit the program.
